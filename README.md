# To-do list

Well, a to-do list!

This was the first project for [DEVinHouse](http://devinhouse.sesisenai.org.br/),
a fullstack development course realized by [Faculdade SENAI](http://sc.senai.br/)
in partnership with [SENAI](http://sc.senai.br/), [Softplan](https://www.softplan.com.br/)
and [ACATE](https://www.acate.com.br/en/home/).

Made with html, css, vanilla js and tons of passion!
